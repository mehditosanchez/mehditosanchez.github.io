  <h1 id="knuckles"> Learn about Knuckles's history </h1>
<center><img src="b84.png" height="352" width="470"/></center>

  <p > Ugandan Knuckles is the nickname given to a depiction of the character Knuckles from the Sonic franchise created by YouTuber Gregzilla, which is often used as an avatar by players in the multiplayer game VRChat who repeat phrases like “do you know the way” and memes associated with the country Uganda, most notably the film <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEoGrbKAyKE"  target="_blank">  Who Killed Captain Alex </a> ? and <a  href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zulul"  target="_blank">  Zulul </a> . This avatar is mainly used in the videogame VR chat to "troll" other players. What was supposed to be a space designed to meet people quickly turned into a trollfest.</p> 
  <h2 id="use"> "Ugandan Knuckles" is overtaking VRChat </h2>
<center><img src="hqdefault.jpg" height="352" width="470" /></center>
  <p > It wasn’t until September 2017 that a 3D model of the deformed echidna entered the world, giving birth to memesters everywhere. Still, it would be another three months before players of VRChat — a Second Life-esque world that lets Oculus Rift and HTC Vive owners inhabit 3D models and interact with others in a variety of settings — latched on to the model, downloading it in hordes and inserting hundreds of strange Knuckles into the game. The goal for those involved in the meme, who play versions of Knuckles ranging from microscopic to 20-feet tall in size, is primarily to pester other players in VRChat, going up to random people in public rooms and annoying them. When asked by other players what their purpose is, many people playing the role of Ugandan Knuckles respond by saying they need to “find the way” and rescue their queen.</p>
  <h2 id="controversy"> Controversy </h2>
<center><img src="j7c8BzQjMK-4.png" height="352" width="470" /></center>
  <p > "Regardless of what the intention of the meme is, the result is blatantly racist.

      The Ugandan Knuckles meme has reached a point where its offensiveness and annoyance has bothered a majority of VRChat users. There are reports that some players will block any Ugandan Knuckles from being able to interact with them in a public room upon sight." <br/><br/>
     This meme is very controversial. Either you like it or you despise it. As for those behind the movie <em>Who killed captain Alex ?</em>, they're not offended at all. On the contrary they love this meme and the way it mocks their movie. </p>
